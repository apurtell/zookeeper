# apache-zookeeper (zk-client) implementation guide

This guide describes the inner structure of the `apache-zookeeper`
crate (directory `crates/zk-client`) for contributors. It divides the
crate into eight packages: `values`, `codec`, `futures`, `watch`,
`host-observe`, `client`, `tls` and `sasl`. In this guide, a package is
a group of source files with one job. It is not a Cargo package. Read
the guide before you make a change that crosses packages.

The sources of the design are this guide and `design/specification.md`,
section "The Native Rust API" (cited as "spec"). The spec section
"Drivers and I/O Architecture" gives the driver contract. When this
guide and the spec disagree, the spec wins. Section 6 lists the known
differences from the spec and the open issues.

## 1. Rules for every package

### 1.1 Ownership

- Each package owns the files of section 3. The shared files of section
  2.1 hold the infrastructure of all packages. A change to a shared file
  affects every package, so keep it small and explain it in the review.
- zk-client uses only the public API of `zk-proto`, `zk-driver` and
  `zk-jute`. It never re-exports their types. A fix in one of those
  crates goes into that crate.
- The doc comment of each function is its contract. When the contract
  and the spec disagree, the spec wins. Fix the code, or record the
  difference in section 6.
- A `pub(crate)` signature is a contract between packages. When you
  change it, change every caller in the same commit. Private functions,
  fields and types are free to change.
- The fields of a struct belong to the file that declares it. Other
  files use the methods of the owner. The `Router` and `Shared` fields
  are `pub(crate)` for reads only.

### 1.2 Code rules

- MSRV is Rust 1.85, edition 2024. Let-chains are not available. Check
  every std API that you use against 1.85.
- The workspace lints deny `unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, `panic`,
  `indexing_slicing`, `arithmetic_side_effects`, `dbg_macro`,
  `print_stdout`, `print_stderr`, `large_stack_arrays` and
  `large_stack_frames`. `missing_docs` and `unreachable_pub` warn, and
  the checks use `-D warnings`. The crate has `#![deny(missing_docs)]`
  and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. Use `get`, `checked_*`, `wrapping_*`
  and `saturating_*`. Do not use `as` casts. Use `try_from` and `from`.
- Production code never panics. `ZPath::from_static` gives `None`
  for a bad literal; a `const` item unwraps it at compile time. Test
  modules may use a module-level `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used, ...)]`.
- User code (`Resolve`, `Metrics`, wakers) runs inside
  `std::panic::catch_unwind` with `AssertUnwindSafe`, and with no
  internal lock held. A waker is taken out under its lock and called
  after the lock is released.
- Use `crate::sync::LockExt::lock_unpoisoned` for every `Mutex`, and
  `sync::wait` and `sync::wait_until` for every `Condvar`. A poisoned lock
  is never an error.
- A blocking wait first checks `sync::blocking_refused(tokio_driver)`.
  When it is true, the wait returns `Error::InvalidState` or
  `WatchError::InvalidState` at once. `tokio_driver` is true when the
  tokio driver runs the client of the wait.
- Allowed dependencies: `zk-driver`, `zk-proto`, `zk-jute`, `bitflags`,
  `zeroize`, `rustix`, and the optional `tokio` (Unix), `futures-core`,
  `tracing`, `log`, `rustls`, `rustls-platform-verifier`, `serde`,
  `md-5`, `getrandom` and `libgssapi`. Dev-dependencies:
  `zk-fakeserver` (with `tls`), `zk-testkit`, `tokio`, `proptest`. A new
  dependency or a new feature needs a separate review, because it
  changes the supply chain of every build.
- Every new file starts with the ASF header of the other files, then a
  blank line.
- Comments follow ASD-STE100: short sentences, active voice, present
  tense. They explain the design, not each line.

### 1.3 Checks for each package

Run these checks before you send a change. Use the three feature sets
below. Never use `--all-features`: exactly one TLS provider is allowed
(`lib.rs` has the `compile_error!` checks). A change to the `sasl`
package also needs a feature set with `sasl`.

```sh
for fs in --features=tokio,tracing,stream \
          --no-default-features \
          --features=tokio,blocking,tls-rustls,tls-ring,log; do
  cargo build  -p apache-zookeeper $fs
  cargo clippy -p apache-zookeeper --all-targets $fs -- -D warnings
  cargo +1.85.0 check -p apache-zookeeper --all-targets $fs
  RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc -p apache-zookeeper --no-deps $fs
  cargo test   -p apache-zookeeper $fs
done
cargo fmt -p apache-zookeeper --check
```

### 1.4 Tests

- Unit tests in the `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` of a source file test
  private state only. They build the inputs by hand: a
  `zk_proto::OpResult` (`RawResult`) for a decoder, a `Slot` for a
  future, a `StateCell` for the state logic. `Weak::new()` stands in for
  a missing `Shared`.
- Tests of the public API go in `tests/`. The fake-server tests use
  `tests/common/mod.rs`: `fake()`, `builder(connect_string)`, `WAIT`,
  `RealServer`, `real_port` and the other shared helpers of section
  2.1. A helper that only one test file uses stays in that file. A
  helper that several test files use goes in `tests/common/mod.rs`.
- The test files have these groups. `api_*.rs` checks the API
  contracts. `c_*.rs` ports the C client suites. `fault_*.rs` injects
  faults through the fake server. `real_*.rs` runs against a real
  server. Most other files belong to one package (section 3).
- Real-server tests have `#[ignore = "real-server"]`. They take the
  port from `common::real_port(offset)`, which reads
  `ZK_TEST_PORT_BASE`. Parallel runs on one host use different bases.
  With no base, the test returns early. With `ZK_TEST_REQUIRE_SERVER`
  set, a missing base fails the test. `RealServer` stops its server on
  drop.
- The zeroization tests have `#[ignore = "free-scan"]`. The script
  `tests/free_scan/free_scan.sh` runs them with a scanner of freed heap
  blocks.
- `tests/smoke.rs` uses only the public value types.

## 2. Shared structure

### 2.1 Shared files

These files hold the infrastructure of all packages. No single package
owns them.

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `Cargo.toml` | Dependencies and the features (`tokio`, `tracing`, `stream`, `blocking`, `log`, `tls-rustls`, `tls-ring`, `tls-aws-lc-rs`, `tls-aws-lc-rs-fips`, `tls-platform-verifier`, `serde`, `sasl`, `sasl-gssapi`). |
| `src/lib.rs` | The module tree, the re-exports and the provider `compile_error!` checks. |
| `src/sync.rs` | `LockExt`, `wait`, `wait_until`, the IO-side marker (`enter_io_side`, `on_io_side`, `blocking_refused`). |
| `src/secret.rs` | `SecretString`. |
| `src/types.rs` | `Zxid`, `SessionId`, `SessionPassword`, `Version`, `VersionArg`, `Stat`, `EphemeralKind`, `Ttl`, `CreateMode`. |
| `src/acl.rs` | `Perms`, `Id`, `Acl` and the standard lists. |
| `src/slot.rs` | `Slot<T>` and `Taken<T>`: the result cell and the read-gate count. |
| `src/tokens.rs` | `NativeTokens`, `WatchId`, `NativeCompletion`, `ReplyToken`, `AuthToken`, `RawResult`. |
| `src/rng.rs` | `NativeRng` (SplitMix64). |
| `src/route.rs` | `Router`: the `RouteSink` of the client. |
| `src/driver.rs` | `DriverHandle`, `CloseWait`, `ExitSignal`, `ClientSpawner`, `driver::start`. |
| `src/shared.rs` | `Shared`, `ClientConfig`, `OneshotReg`, `PersistentReg`: the submit path and the watch detach rule. |
| `src/blocking.rs` | `blocking::Client`. Each method calls the async method and `wait()`. |
| `src/follow.rs` | The config follower of `update_servers_from_config` (section 6). |
| `src/serde_impls.rs` | The `serde` rules of `Perms` and `Ttl` (feature `serde`). |
| `tests/common/mod.rs` | `RealServer`, `real_port`, `fake`, `builder`, `WAIT`, and the helpers that several test files share, among them `within`, `connect`, `setup`, `fixture`, `wait_info`, `thread` and `ca_only`. |
| `tests/common/proxy.rs` | `Proxy`: the loopback TCP proxy of the real-server tests, with the cut, hold and mute modes and a delay. The zk-recipes tests include this file with `#[path]`. |
| `tests/smoke.rs` | Value-type smoke tests. |

### 2.2 The layers

```
user code
   |  Client::op(..) -> ResponseFuture        (client: client.rs, builder.rs)
   v
path::checked -> ops::* -> Shared::request    (values, codec; shared.rs)
   |  register_oneshot / register_persistent: sink before submit
   v
DriverHandle::submit (core lock) -> zk_proto::Connection   (driver.rs)
   |
   |  IO side: zk-driver thread or tokio task, core unlocked
   v
Router::route(Item)                            (route.rs)
   |-- Result  -> ReplyToken::complete -> Slot<RawResult>
   |-- Watch   -> WatchSinks::deliver_event -> Delivery::apply   (watch)
   |-- Session -> StateCell::on_session -> Observer::state_changed (watch, host-observe)
   |-- Log     -> Observer::log                                (host-observe)
   v
ResponseFuture::poll / wait (caller task)      (futures)
   -> decode::* or multi::decode_* (caller task)   (codec)
   -> OneshotWatcher / PersistentWatcher made by decode::with_* (watch)
```

`ClientBuilder::build` (client) makes the pieces: the `Observer`
(host-observe), the `StateCell` (watch), the `Router`, the `NativeHost`
(host-observe), the TLS connector and error probe (tls), the proto
`Connection` with `Compat::NATIVE`, and then `driver::start` and
`Shared::new`.

### 2.3 Locks

| Lock | Owner | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| core (`zk-driver`) | driver | Taken only inside `DriverHandle` calls. No zk-client lock is held across a `DriverHandle` call. Host pure leaves run under it, so they never call user code. |
| `Router::sinks` | watch (`WatchSinks`) | Leaf. Plan under it, apply after it is released. |
| `Slot` | shared (`slot.rs`) | Leaf. The waker runs after release. |
| `EventQueue` | watch | Leaf. The waker runs after release. |
| `StateCell` | watch | Leaf. The wakers run after release. |
| `ReadyWaiters` | futures | Leaf. |
| `ExitSignal` | shared (`driver.rs`) | Leaf. |
| `TlsInner` cache and last error | tls | Leaf. File IO runs with the lock released. |
| `LastSaslError` | sasl | Leaf. The adapter writes it. The error probe of `build` reads it for `last_error_for`. |

No code holds two zk-client locks at once. User code runs with no lock
held.

### 2.4 The read gate

The driver stops reading when `dispatch_queue_capacity` values wait in
receivers. `Router::route` returns true for a value that a live receiver
must still take. The receiver calls `Shared::taken` once when it takes
or drops a counted value (`Taken::Value { counted: true, .. }` or
`Slot::drop_receiver() == true`). Every consumer of a slot or a one-shot
sink keeps this rule. Persistent events never count.

### 2.5 Call graph

## 3. Packages

Each package lists its files, its design sources, its main functions,
its calls, its invariants and its test coverage.

### values

Files: `src/path.rs`, `src/error.rs`, `src/connect_string.rs`,
`src/config.rs`, `src/auth.rs`, `tests/values.rs`.

Design: spec "Client Construction and Configuration" (connect string),
"Operations, Result Types, and Error Handling" (paths and errors),
"Transactions and Dynamic Reconfiguration" (config text); Java
`DigestAuthenticationProvider`, `QuorumPeerConfig`.

Main functions:

| Function | File |
|---|---|
| `check_static` (const fn, manual UTF-8 decode) | path.rs |
| `ZPath::{parent, name, join, starts_with}`, `Components::next` | path.rs |
| `Error::{code, from_code, is_connection_loss, is_session_terminal, is_retry_safe}` | error.rs |
| `Display` for `Error`, `DisconnectCause`, `MultiError`, `WatchError` | error.rs |
| `map_submit_error`, `last_error_for` | error.rs |
| `connect_string::{parse, parse_update}` | connect_string.rs |
| `parse_config`, `Reconfig::wire`, `EnsembleConfig::client_connect_string` | config.rs |
| `digest_id`, `sha1`, `base64` | auth.rs |

Calls made: `zk_proto::native::{validate_path_strict,
parse_connect_string_native}`, `zk_proto::Cause`, `zk_proto::Stage`.

Calls received: client (paths, errors, connect strings, `Reconfig`),
codec (`Error::from_code`, `parse_config`), route (`last_error_for`),
shared (`map_submit_error`), `Id::digest`.

Invariants:

- `check_static` accepts exactly the paths that `ZPath::new` accepts.
  A const item with a bad literal fails to compile.
- `Error::code` and `from_code` are inverse for every code of `Error`.
  `from_code` gives `None` for 0 and maps an unknown code to
  `Error::Unknown(rc)`. One `server_codes!` table in error.rs gives
  `code`, `from_code` and the `Display` text of each server code. The
  macro expands inside the one `impl Error` block, so the predicates stay
  in plain code.
- `is_retry_safe` follows the retry rule: reads are safe after
  `ConnectionLoss`, writes are not. A lost reply hides whether the
  server applied a write.
- `last_error_for` gives `Set` with a `DisconnectCause` for each proto
  `Cause`. The TLS error of the probe wins when it exists.
- `parse` rejects an empty host list and a bad port with
  `Error::InvalidArgument`. `parse_update` also rejects a chroot.
- `parse_config` is lenient: it skips a line that it cannot read and
  keeps the raw text and the hex version.
- `digest_id("u", "p")` equals the Java `generateDigest` output. Compare
  with `zk_fakeserver::digest_id`.

Test coverage: path edge cases (root, trailing slash, `.` and `..`
components, NUL, the reserved range); `from_static` in a const item;
the code round trip; each `Display` text; connect strings with IPv6,
default port and chroot; a sample `/zookeeper/config`; digest vectors
(FIPS 180-4 "abc", Java values); proptest for `parse` and
`ZPath::new` (no panic on any input).

### codec

Files: `src/decode.rs`, `src/ops.rs`, `src/multi.rs`,
`tests/codec_fake.rs`.

Design: spec "Operations, Result Types, and Error Handling" (create
modes, ACLs, null data, operations and op codes), "Transactions and
Dynamic Reconfiguration" (transactions), "Wire records" (the jute
records).

Main functions:

| Function | File |
|---|---|
| `reply_of`, `void`, `create`, `exists`, `get_data`, `get_data_opt`, `stat`, `children`, `children2`, `acl`, `children_count`, `ephemerals`, `who_am_i`, `config` | decode.rs |
| `create_mode_wire`, `acl_to_jute`, `acl_from_jute`, `create` | ops.rs |
| `MultiWriter::{create, delete, set_data, check, to_ops}` (`to_ops` gives borrowed `MultiOpRef` sub-ops) | multi.rs |
| `MultiResults::get` | multi.rs |
| `MultiReader::{get_data, get_children, to_ops}` | multi.rs |
| `decode_multi`, `decode_multi_read` | multi.rs |

Calls made: `zk_proto::{Op, Reply, OpResult, MultiOp}`, the jute
records, and from values `Error::from_code`, `parse_config`, `path::checked`.

Calls received: client (every builder and decoder), watch
(`decode::void` for `remove`).

Invariants:

- A decoder never panics. A wrong reply variant gives
  `Error::MarshallingError`.
- `exists` maps `NoNode` to `Ok(None)`.
- `get_data` maps null data to an empty vector. `get_data_opt` keeps
  `None`.
- `create_mode_wire` gives the Java flag values and the TTL.
  A TTL mode uses op 21, a container op 19, every other mode op 15.
- `decode_multi` gives `MultiError::Aborted { index, error, per_op }`
  for a rolled-back transaction and `MultiError::Request` for a failed
  request. Its `MultiResults` accepts only the handles of the same
  `writer_id`.
- `MultiResults::get` returns `None` for a handle of another writer or
  a result of another type.
- Builders never fail. The path is already checked.

Test coverage: each decoder with a good reply, an error rc, a missing
reply and the wrong variant; every create mode; ACL round trip;
transactions with a failing op in the middle; reads with mixed
results. `tests/codec_fake.rs` holds the fake-server tests.

### futures

Files: `src/future.rs`, `tests/futures_fake.rs`.

Design: spec "Core Design Principles" (`ResponseFuture`), "Lifecycle
Management and Teardown" (close), "Client Construction and
Configuration" (backpressure), "Execution Runtimes" (blocking); section
2.4 (read gate).

Main functions:

| Function | File |
|---|---|
| `ResponseFuture::{is_ready, wait, wait_timeout}`, `Future::poll`, `Drop` | future.rs |
| `CloseFuture::wait`, `Future::poll` | future.rs |
| `ReadyFuture::wait`, `Future::poll` | future.rs |

Calls made: `Slot`, `Shared::{taken, terminal_error, pending_len}`,
`CloseWait::{poll, wait}`, `ReadyWaiters`, `sync::blocking_refused`.

Calls received: every caller of a request method; `blocking::Client`;
`ConnectFuture` (client).

Invariants:

- Cancel safety: a value leaves the slot only when `poll` or `wait`
  returns it.
- The read gate: a counted value calls `Shared::taken` exactly once,
  in `poll`, `wait` or `Drop` (section 2.4).
- `Drop` in `Waiting` drops the receiver first, then the decoder. A
  decoder that holds a watch registration removes its sink in its own
  drop.
- A closed slot gives `Shared::terminal_error()`, or `Error::Closing`
  when the client is gone or not terminal.
- `wait_timeout` gives the future back unchanged after the timeout.
- `ReadyFuture` resolves when `pending_len` is below half of
  `max_pending`, at once with no limit, and with the terminal error on
  a terminal client. It uses the `ReadyWaiters` generation, so no wake
  is lost.
- `CloseFuture` resolves when the driver exits. The result is `Ok`
  for a clean close, and a second close gives the same result.

Test coverage: poll and wait with a filled, a closed and an empty slot;
drop with a counted value; `wait_timeout` expiry; the blocking refusal
on the IO side (`enter_io_side`); `ReadyFuture` wake order.
`tests/futures_fake.rs` holds the end-to-end tests.

### watch

Files: `src/watch/mod.rs`, `src/watch/sinks.rs`, `src/watch/oneshot.rs`,
`src/watch/persistent.rs`, `src/watch/state.rs`, `tests/watch_fake.rs`.

Design: spec "Watcher Abstractions and Event Streaming", "Watcher
tables", "Operations, Result Types, and Error Handling" (`last_error`),
"Lifecycle Management and Teardown" (close), "Execution Runtimes"
(blocking).

Main functions:

| Function | File |
|---|---|
| `event_from_proto` | watch/mod.rs |
| `WatchSinks::{deliver_event, terminate, terminate_all}`, `Delivery::apply` | watch/sinks.rs |
| `OneshotWatcher::{remove, wait}`, `Future::poll`, `Drop` | watch/oneshot.rs |
| `EventQueue::{push, terminate, poll_next, wait_next, drop_receiver}` | watch/persistent.rs |
| `PersistentWatcher::{remove, recv}`, `Drop` | watch/persistent.rs |
| `StateCell::{on_session, set_closed, set_last_error, terminal_error, poll_changed, wait_changed}`, `StateWatcher::wait_changed` | watch/state.rs |

Calls made: `Slot`, `Shared::{taken, terminal_error, remove_watch,
drop_watch_sink}`, `ResponseFuture::{ready, waiting}`, `decode::void`,
`ZPathBuf::from_server`.

Calls received: route (sinks, deliveries, `event_from_proto`, the state
cell), client (`StateWatcher::new`, `snapshot`), codec
(`OneshotReg::arm` makes a `OneshotWatcher`), futures (none).

Invariants:

- A one-shot sink gives exactly one outcome. Only the first one-shot
  delivery of one `Watch` item counts.
- Several watchers get an event in the given order.
- A persistent queue with no bound never drops. With a bound, a full
  queue drops the event, counts it, and the next take gives `Lagged`
  first. A terminal error never takes a queue slot. After the terminal
  error, the watcher gives `None`.
- `Drop` and `remove` go through `Shared::drop_watch_sink` and
  `Shared::remove_watch`, so proto decides when `RemoveWatches` goes out.
- `on_session` follows the mapping of its doc comment. A terminal state
  never changes. `epoch` grows at each connect. Wakers run after the
  lock is released.
- `poll_changed` resolves at once after a terminal state, always.
- An event with a path that is not UTF-8 gives `None` and is dropped.
  A public `String` path cannot hold such bytes.

Test coverage: unit tests for every planner and the queue (bound,
`Lagged`, terminal, receiver gone); the state mapping table;
`poll_changed` after a terminal state. `tests/watch_fake.rs` holds
the end-to-end tests: arm on a missing node, event after reply,
remove, drop, restore after reconnect.

### host-observe

Files: `src/host.rs`, `src/observe.rs`, `tests/host_observe.rs`.

Design: spec "Client Construction and Configuration" (`Resolve`,
`ServerOrder`, `DnsRefresh`), "Core Design Principles" (user code on
the IO side), "Observability and Diagnostic Instrumentation", "Host
resolution, DNS, and failover mechanics" (the resolve leaf).

Main functions:

| Function | File |
|---|---|
| `HostLeaves::resolve` for `NativeHost`, `StdResolve::resolve` | host.rs |
| `Observer::{log_enabled, log, request_completed, state_changed, watch_event, watch_lagged, pending_requests, run}` | observe.rs |

Calls made: `Resolve`, `std::net::ToSocketAddrs`, `sync::enter_io_side`,
`catch_unwind`, `tracing` (feature `tracing`), `log` (feature `log`
without `tracing`), `Metrics`.

Calls received: zk-driver (the host leaves), route (`Observer::*`),
client (`NativeHost::new`, `Observer::new`).

Invariants:

- `resolve` runs the user resolver inside `enter_io_side` and
  `catch_unwind`. A panic, an error and an empty list all fail the
  host. The error maps as `StdHostLeaves` maps it (`gai_rc`, `errno`).
  `skipped_families` is empty.
- A legacy host spec gives `EAI_NONAME`.
- The pure leaves never call user code.
- `Observer::run` catches a panic of the hook, logs it once and
  disables the hook for this client.
- `log` renders each `LogRecord` with the client name as a field. With
  neither `tracing` nor `log`, it does nothing and `log_enabled` is
  false.

Test coverage: resolver success, error, empty list and panic; the
blocking refusal inside the resolver; the metrics panic rule; the log
level filter. `tests/host_observe.rs` holds the end-to-end tests.

### client

Files: `src/client.rs`, `src/builder.rs`, `tests/client_fake.rs`,
`tests/client_real.rs`.

Design: spec "Client Construction and Configuration", "Execution
Runtimes", "Core Design Principles" (call pattern), "Operations,
Result Types, and Error Handling", "Transactions and Dynamic
Reconfiguration" (reconfig and `update_servers`), "Modern Protocol
Capabilities", "Lifecycle Management and Teardown", "Compatibility
policies and operational modes" (`Compat::NATIVE`).

Main functions:

| Function | File |
|---|---|
| Every request method of `Client` | client.rs |
| `ClientBuilder::{connect, build}` | builder.rs |
| `ConnectFuture::wait`, `Future::poll` | builder.rs |

Calls made: section 2.5, rows "client".

Calls received: user code, `blocking::Client`.

Invariants:

- Each request method follows the pattern of the `client.rs` module
  doc. The submit happens before the method returns.
- A bad path gives `ResponseFuture::ready(Err(InvalidPath))` and sends
  nothing.
- A watched read registers its sink before the submit
  (`Shared::register_oneshot`).
- `get_config` and `get_config_watched` ignore the chroot.
- `build` sets `Compat::NATIVE` with `max_frame_len` and `tls_verify`,
  `Config::max_pending`, `restore_watches`, `connect_timeout_ms`,
  `reconnect_delay_ms`, `reconnect_jitter_pct` (25),
  `close_timeout_ms`, the session id and password, and the chroot.
- `connect` builds at once, so `ConnectFuture::state_watcher` is valid
  at once (section 6). It resolves after `Connected` (or
  `ConnectedReadOnly` when allowed) and after every builder `auth`
  result.
- `close` starts the close in the call and gives the same outcome on a
  second call. `detach` keeps the session and gives its credentials.
- `session`, `negotiated_timeout`, `last_zxid`, `connected_server` and
  `stats` read `Connection::{client_id, recv_timeout, last_zxid,
  current_server}` through `Shared::read_conn`, and `epoch` from the
  state cell. `negotiated_timeout` is `None` before the first
  connection. `connected_server` is `None` while not connected.
- `update_servers` parses with `connect_string::parse_update`, then
  calls `DriverHandle::set_servers`.

Test coverage: every method against the fake server; ordering of
pipelined calls; `connect` with good and bad auth and with an expired
resumed session; `close` and `detach`; the blocking facade (feature
`blocking`); `tests/client_real.rs` covers the same against a real
server (`#[ignore = "real-server"]`).

### tls

Files: `src/tls.rs`, `tests/tls_fake.rs`, `tests/tls_options.rs`,
`tests/tls_keys.rs`, `tests/tls_real.rs`.

Design: spec "Native Security Configuration", "Security Architecture:
TLS and SASL", "TLS transport integration" (the native connector).

Main functions:

| Function | File |
|---|---|
| `Display` for `TlsConfigError` | tls.rs |
| `TlsOptions::{legacy_c_compat, check, connector, error_probe}` | tls.rs |
| `NativeConfig::client_config` for `TlsInner` | tls.rs |
| `TlsOptionsBuilder::build` | tls.rs |

Calls made: `rustls`, `zk_driver::net::tls::{NativeConfig,
RustlsConnector::native, default_provider, TlsSetupError,
TlsPurpose}`, `rustix::process::{getuid, geteuid, getgid, getegid}`.

Calls received: client (`build` calls `check`, `connector`,
`error_probe`, `tls_verify`), zk-driver (`client_config` at each
attempt).

Invariants:

- `build` reads and checks every file, so a bad file fails early.
- `ReloadPolicy::OnChange` reads a changed file again at the next
  attempt. A failed reload fails the attempt and stores the error for
  `error_probe`.
- `client_config` does file IO with no lock held.
- Key bytes stay in zeroizing buffers.
- The environment rule uses `rustix` for the uid and gid reads. A
  set-uid or set-gid process ignores `SSL_CERT_FILE` and
  `SSL_CERT_DIR`, as OpenSSL does.
- `with_platform_verifier` (feature `tls-platform-verifier`) replaces
  every trust source with the OS verifier. `build` fails with
  `TlsConfigError::PlatformVerifier` when it mixes with `ca_file`,
  `add_system_roots` or `danger_disable_hostname_verification`. It
  also fails in a set-uid or set-gid process on Linux and the BSDs,
  and when the OS verifier does not start.

Test coverage: `build` with a good and a missing CA file; the reload
cache with a changed file; `legacy_c_compat` parsing; a TLS session
against `zk_fakeserver::TlsAcceptor` with the fixtures of
`zk_testkit::fixtures::tls_dir`. zk-testkit makes the
fixtures at test time with OpenSSL 3.4 to 3.x. `ZK_TEST_OPENSSL`
selects the OpenSSL tool.

### sasl

Files: `src/sasl/mod.rs`, `src/sasl/adapter.rs`,
`src/sasl/digest_md5.rs`, `src/sasl/gssapi.rs`, `tests/api_sasl.rs`,
`tests/sasl_fake.rs`, `tests/sasl_native.rs`.

Design: spec "Native Security Configuration", "Security Architecture:
TLS and SASL"; RFC 2831 (DIGEST-MD5).

Main functions:

| Function | File |
|---|---|
| `SaslConfig`, `SaslMechanism`, `SaslMechanismFactory`, `CredentialSource`, `SaslError` | sasl/mod.rs |
| `NativeSasl`: the `zk_proto::SaslSession` adapter | sasl/adapter.rs |
| The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism (feature `sasl`) | sasl/digest_md5.rs |
| The GSSAPI mechanism (feature `sasl-gssapi`) | sasl/gssapi.rs |

Calls made: `zk_proto::SaslSession`, `SecretString`, `md-5`,
`getrandom`, `libgssapi`.

Calls received: client (`ClientBuilder::build` gives the adapter to the
proto `Connection`), zk-proto (the `SaslSession` methods on the IO
side), the error probe (`LastSaslError`).

Invariants:

- zk-proto owns the ZooKeeper SASL rules: the op 102 framing, the send
  gate and the deferred `CONNECTED`. This package only makes the
  mechanism tokens.
- Each start makes a new mechanism from the factory. No state carries
  over from an earlier connection.
- A panic of the mechanism or of the credential source becomes a
  `SaslErrorKind::Mechanism` error. The panic never crosses the driver.
- Every SASL failure is terminal. The session goes to `AuthFailed`.
  `SessionInfo::last_error` then carries the `SaslError`.
- Password bytes stay in `SecretString` and zeroizing buffers.

Test coverage: the public types with no mechanism (`tests/api_sasl.rs`);
DIGEST-MD5 against the fake server (`tests/sasl_fake.rs`); the password
source on each authentication, a real server, and the zeroization of
the password (`tests/sasl_native.rs`).

## 4. Cross-package order

Unit tests make each package testable alone. Each end-to-end test file
in `tests/` also runs the packages below. After a change to a package,
run every test file that uses it.

| Test file | Uses |
|---|---|
| `tests/values.rs` | values |
| `tests/codec_fake.rs` | values, codec, futures, watch, host-observe, client |
| `tests/futures_fake.rs` | all but tls and sasl |
| `tests/watch_fake.rs` | all but tls and sasl |
| `tests/host_observe.rs` | all but tls and sasl |
| `tests/client_fake.rs`, `tests/client_real.rs` | all but tls and sasl |
| `tests/tls_fake.rs` | all but sasl |
| `tests/sasl_fake.rs`, `tests/sasl_native.rs` | all but tls |

## 5. Review checklist

1. No `todo!` is left: `rg 'todo[!]' crates/zk-client/src` prints
   nothing.
2. The checks of section 1.3 pass with each feature set and with no
   warning.
3. The real-server tests pass with a `ZK_TEST_PORT_BASE` of your own.
4. A new difference from the spec goes in section 6.

## 6. Known differences and open issues

- Module layout: the futures are in `future.rs`, not `client.rs`, so
  the futures and client packages own different files. `decode.rs`,
  `ops.rs`, `shared.rs`, `route.rs`, `driver.rs`, `host.rs` and
  `follow.rs` are private modules that the spec does not name.
- The `serde` feature covers `Stat`, `Acl`, `Id`,
  `Perms`, `Zxid`, `SessionId` and `CreateMode`. It also covers
  `Version` and `Ttl`, because `Stat` and `CreateMode` hold them.
  `Perms` is its wire `i32`, and `Ttl` is its value in ms.
- `ClientBuilder::connect` builds at once. Nothing waits for the
  first poll. Thus `ConnectFuture::state_watcher` is valid at once.
- `get_children` returns `Vec<String>` (spec). `get_children_with_stat`
  gives the stat too. Versions take `impl VersionArg` (`Version` or
  `None`).
- `StateWatcher::last_error` is a spec addition. `StateWatcher` holds
  an `Arc<StateCell>`, and `wait_changed` (feature `blocking`) is an
  addition.
- `MultiResults::get` returns `Option`. `ReadyFuture` gives a
  `Result`.
- The drivers do not count bytes. Thus `ClientStats::{sent, received}`
  stay 0, and the client never calls `Metrics::bytes`.
- `blocking_refused` refuses a wait on the IO side of any client. For
  a client of the tokio driver, it also refuses a wait in any tokio
  runtime context. Tokio has no public test that tells a worker from a
  `spawn_blocking` thread, so such a client also refuses a wait in
  `spawn_blocking`. A client of the thread driver accepts a wait in
  each tokio context, also in a worker, because the wait cannot stop
  its driver.
- With no `ClientBuilder::runtime`, the client uses the current tokio
  runtime only when it is a multi-thread runtime. A current-thread
  runtime gets the thread driver.
- The futures and the one-shot watcher registrations keep a
  `driver::Gate`, the read gate reporter of the driver. Thus a take
  after the last `Client` drop still opens the read gate.
- `update_servers_from_config` uses the follower in `follow.rs`. It
  reads `/zookeeper/config` with a watch, through the completion kind
  `NativeCompletion::Follow`. Each new config text replaces the server
  list. The first read applies too.
- The tokio driver has no exit hook. The router ends the sinks at a
  terminal session state. A follower task also calls `Router::on_exit`
  when the driver task ends, or when a runtime shutdown drops it.
- `Connection::detach_watcher` gives a `RemoveHint` only when no request
  in flight sets the same watch. The router detaches again when a
  reply has no receiver, so the hint comes then.
- A connect, IO or socket cause with an OS errno gets
  `io::Error::from_raw_os_error` as its `last_error`. The errno comes
  from `Connection::last_teardown_errno`. A `Cause` with no errno gets
  a synthetic `io::Error` in `DisconnectCause`.
- `rustls` types (`ServerName`, `SupportedProtocolVersion`,
  `ClientConfig`) are in the public TLS API.
- `TlsOptions` loads the trust and identity files through the zk-driver
  loaders (`TrustSet`, `Identity`). Thus the native and the drop-in
  clients read the same file formats.
- `tls-platform-verifier` uses `rustls-platform-verifier`. The OS
  verifier replaces the trust sources of `TlsOptions`, so the two
  cannot mix.
- The `AuthToken` slot holds a `RawResult`, so `add_auth` uses the
  normal `ResponseFuture`.
