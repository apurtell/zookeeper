# Turns one tests/abi/layout/<target>.expect file into the fact table of

# Usage: awk -v config=plain|tls-sasl -f layout-facts.awk <target>.expect
#
# Each output line is ZK_FACT(expression, value, "description"). The
# tls-sasl table is the plain table with the tls-sasl rows applied over
# it, because the expect file lists only the tls-sasl facts that differ.
