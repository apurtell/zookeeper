/*
 * st zoo_state during a TLS handshake (TL-02, ST-16).
 *
 * Mode EXACT, with DEV checks under SEC-1.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - ST-16: on the EINPROGRESS path the state is 7
 *   (SSL_CONNECTING_STATE_DEF) during the handshake (zookeeper.c 2699-2703).
 * - TL-02: on the immediate path the state keeps 0 or 999 until the
 *   handshake completes, and then becomes ASSOCIATING. Legacy runs the
 *   handshake inside zookeeper_interest. The Rust core runs it without
 *   blocking, so more passes can show the old state.
 *
 * The case drives a handle to CONNECTED on each path and records each
 * change of zoo_state. A state that changes in the interest call and
 * again in the next process call is visible only between the two calls,
 * so the case looks at both points. The trace does not show the call of
 * a change, because the Rust handshake does not block (SEC-1). A DEV
 * check records that call for the first pass of the immediate path.
 * The connect preload forces the path. The trust is the testSSL
 * fixture: the CA file is server.crt, and the client identity is
 * client.crt and clientkey.pem.
 *
 * zkconf-flavors: st
 * zkconf-preload: connect
