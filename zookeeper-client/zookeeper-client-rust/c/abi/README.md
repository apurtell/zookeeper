# C client ABI goldens and export tools

This directory holds the ABI files that the build of the Rust drop-in
libraries `libzookeeper_mt` and `libzookeeper_st` uses. The release ships
them. The goldens come from a build of the legacy C client. The
`cargo xtask` tasks in `zookeeper-client-rust/xtask` generate and check
them. Do not edit the generated files by hand.

| File | Content | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `symbols.tsv` | The export set of both flavors in all four configurations. It is the single export source. | `abi golden` |
| `static-symbols.tsv` | The globals that only the static archives define. | `abi golden` |
| `gen-exports.awk` | The export-list generator. It reads the two TSV files and writes the `.sym`, `.map`, `.exp`, `.def` and `.keep` lists of a flavor and a configuration. | none |
| `prelink.sh` | The pre-link step of Make and CMake. It joins the shim archive of a flavor and the `zk-ffi` staticlib into one relocatable object. Only the names of the keep list stay global. | none |
| `tls-probe.sh` | The TLS decision and the default trust paths of the Maven build. It uses the OpenSSL probe of configure and prints `tls`, `openssl` (the header probe result), `cert_file` and `cert_dir`. | none |

The ABI data for development and conformance checks is in
`../tests/abi` (`zookeeper-client-rust/c/tests/abi`). The build does not
read it, so a release can omit it:

| File | Content | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `absent.tsv` | The names that a shared library must not export. | `abi golden` |
| `log-sites.tsv` | The `LOG_*` call sites of the C core, with level and format. | `log-sites` |
| `layout/probe.c` | The L1 layout probe of the public types. | `layout gen` |
| `layout/<target>.expect` | The measured layout facts for one target. | `layout expect` |

The column descriptions below cover the files of both directories.

## Columns

`symbols.tsv` has the columns `name kind flavors feature rw size_lp64 size_ilp32 decl note`.

- `kind` is `func` or `data`.
- `flavors` is `mt,st` or `mt`.
- `feature` is `-` (always present), `ssl` (only with TLS) or `sasl` (only with SASL).
- `rw` is `ro` or `rw` for data, and `-` for functions.
- `size_lp64` and `size_ilp32` are the data object sizes in bytes, and `-` for functions.
- `decl` is the declaring installed header and line, or `-`.
- `note` records the ABI-01 facts, for example an export that no installed header declares.

The export totals for mt/st are: plain 201/178, ssl 202/179, sasl 210/187,
full 211/188. In every configuration, 36 exports are data. Of these, 30 are
read-only `const int` objects and 6 are writable.

`static-symbols.tsv` has the columns `name kind decl note`. All 179 rows
apply to both flavors and to every configuration.

`absent.tsv` has the columns `name flavors class decl`. The `class` column
has one of these values:

- `archive-only`: the name is in `static-symbols.tsv`.
- `internal`: an undeclared legacy global that DV-ABI-1 removes.
- `undefined`: no library defines the name.
- `mt-only`: a sync function that only mt defines, so st must not export it.

`log-sites.tsv` has a header comment that describes its columns. The `line`
column is the line of the macro name. The `line_end` column is the line of
the closing parenthesis. Apple clang expands `__LINE__` to `line_end` when a
call spans more than one line.

`<target>.expect` has the columns `config fact type member value`. The
`plain` rows apply to the headers without `HAVE_OPENSSL_H` and
`HAVE_CYRUS_SASL_H`. The `tls-sasl` rows list only the facts that are new
or different when both macros are defined.

## Reference build

The goldens come from an autotools build of the legacy C client
(`zookeeper-client/zookeeper-client-c`) with four
configurations, installed under `/tmp/zk-legacy-ref/install-<config>`:

| Config | configure options |
|---|---|
| plain | `--without-openssl --without-sasl` |
| ssl | `--with-openssl=<openssl@3> --without-sasl` |
| sasl | `--without-openssl --with-sasl=<cyrus-sasl>` |
| full | `--with-openssl=<openssl@3> --with-sasl=<cyrus-sasl>` |

The SASL configurations need `CFLAGS="-g -O2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -Wno-gnu-folding-constant"`
with clang, because `-Werror` stops the build in `zk_sasl.c`.
Build each configuration in its own build directory. Run `autoreconf -if`
in the legacy tree once. Then run `configure` with
`--prefix=/tmp/zk-legacy-ref/install-<config>` and the options of the
table, then `make` and `make install`.

## Commands

Run these commands from `zookeeper-client-rust`.

```sh
# Regenerate the export goldens from the reference build.
cargo xtask abi golden --ref /tmp/zk-legacy-ref

# Regenerate the log-site table, or compare it with the zk-proto table.
cargo xtask log-sites
cargo xtask log-sites --check

# Regenerate the layout probe and the layout facts of the host target.
cargo xtask layout gen
cargo xtask layout expect --include <prefix>/include \
    --full-cflags "-I<openssl@3>/include -I<cyrus-sasl>/include"

# Check a shared library or a static archive against the goldens.
cargo xtask abi check <libzookeeper_mt.dylib> --flavor mt --config plain
cargo xtask abi static <libzookeeper_mt.a> --flavor mt --config plain
```

`abi check` fails when the names, kinds or data sizes differ from
`symbols.tsv`. It also checks the identity of the library, such as the
Mach-O install name and versions. The `--reference` option accepts the
known legacy deviations: DV-TLS-4 for the OpenSSL references and DV-ABI-1
for the archive globals. The checks read `absent.tsv` from the golden
directory when it is there, and otherwise from `../tests/abi`. A tree
without that directory skips check E1.

The `--check` option of `log-sites`, `layout gen` and `layout expect`
compares the output with the file and fails when the file is out of date.

## Layout checks

Three checks cover the layout of the types at the C boundary:

- `layout/<target>.expect` and `../tests/abi/layout_check.c` check the
  public headers against the measured facts of each target. A cross
  compiler can make the facts, because the probe does not run.
- `../shim/zks_layout_check.c` pins the `zkrs.h` layouts of the 64-bit
  and the 32-bit targets. The shim does not compile when a layout
  changes.
- The `zk-ffi-layout` crate compares C with Rust on the build host. It
  reads the member lists of the public types from `layout/probe.c`.
  It compiles a C probe in the `plain`, `ssl`, `sasl` and `full`
  configurations. Then it compares the size, the alignment and each
  field of the `zk-ffi` mirrors and `zkrs.h` types with rustc. It also
  compares the enum values and the constants.

Run these commands from `zookeeper-client-rust`:

```sh
cargo xtask layout gen --check
cargo test --manifest-path crates/zk-ffi-layout/Cargo.toml
```

`zk-ffi-layout` is a separate workspace, so `cargo test --workspace` does
not run it. The test task of the Maven module runs it for the `plain`
configuration, and for `sasl` when the SASL probe passes. Run the `ssl`
and `full` configurations with the command above.
